This directory does not contain any source tarballs.

What it does contain is text file sources that referenced in the RPM spec
files that are not the source tarballs.

The source tarballs can usually be retrieved via `curl` or `wget` from the
URL listed in the RPM spec file.

For spec files building from a git, the source tarball will have to be
retrieved from that git.
