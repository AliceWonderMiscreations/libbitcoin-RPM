This directory does not contain any source tarballs.

What it does contain is text file sources that referenced in the RPM spec
files that are not the source tarballs.

The source tarballs can usually be retrieved via `curl` or `wget` from the
URL listed in the RPM spec file.

No sources for LibreOffice are in this directory, those must be retrieved from
the Fedora Rawhide source RPM.
